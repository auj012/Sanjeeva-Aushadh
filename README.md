# Sanjeevini Aushad

**Applied AI clinical decision support for medication allergen safety.**

Sanjeevini Aushad is an applied AI project that addresses a critical gap in medication safety: patients with documented food allergies can still receive medications containing allergenic inactive ingredients because current prescribing and dispensing workflows rarely cross-check excipients against a patient's allergy profile.

Inspired by my own experience navigating this gap, the project explores how publicly available medication data can be transformed into practical clinical decision support that is explainable, auditable, and designed to assist—not replace—clinical decision-making.

## Data Sources

This project is built using publicly available healthcare datasets, including:

- **openFDA Drug Label API** – active and inactive ingredient data, updated monthly
- **DailyMed Structured Product Labels (SPL)**
- **RxNorm** for medication normalization and standardization

Primary dataset:

## Project Vision

The long-term vision consists of three complementary components:

- **Divya Drishti** – Measure and monitor the prevalence of allergens in FDA-approved medications.
- **Lakshmana Rekha** – Detect potential medication-allergen conflicts before a prescription reaches the patient.
- **Sanjeevini** – Recommend therapeutically equivalent, allergen-safe alternatives when available.
